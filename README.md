 <h1>Highest Profit Challenge</h1>

<h4>Description:</h4>

<p>I chose this challenge because it was one I was most familiar in use of technologies and how to obtain the expected outputs. This project's input required was firstly, the .csv file. In the algorithm to produce the desired output I converted the file into a list to be able to have headers as the list's key. I also created a condition that helped produce the print of total number of rows with valid numerical value by using the "-" operator within my condition statement. I wanted to reduce iterations so I used conditions that would count both valid and invalid profits (numerical values and non-numerical values.</p>
